# Homework 1

Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider:

- _What are the essential pieces of functionality?_

  > keep tracking of piece positions, buying and selling property, rolling dice, paying and collecting rent, going to and leaving jail, making change when collecting payments, handling community and chance cards

- _How would people cheat?_

  > trying to tamper with the randomness of the dice roll and the community and chance cards, not paying rent, leaving jail without meeting the conditions, stealing money from the bank when making change

- _How could you prevent them from cheating?_

  > make every transaction and game state change transparent and auditable, try to make the randomness as tamperproof and unpredictable as possible, restrict the game from continuing until the game state is in a correct state (rent being paid, bank has the correct amount of money, pieces in the right position, etc.)

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design
