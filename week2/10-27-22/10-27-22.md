# Homework 8

Using your choice of hardhat, foundry or truffle:

1. Create a project for your Volcano coin ✅
2. Write unit tests for your Volcano coin contract. The tests should show that:
   1. The total supply is initially 10000 ✅
   2. That the total supply can be increased in 1000 token steps ✅
   3. Only the owner of the contract can increase the supply ✅
