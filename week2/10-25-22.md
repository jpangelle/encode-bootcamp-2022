- Deploy the contract to Goelri testnet and note the address it was deployed to:

The treasure contract looks like [this](https://gist.github.com/letsgitcracking/a7d3d62df2d4a13f6b1cf9991da795d9). Once you have found it on the testnet, you need to:

- Call it from your interface contract with your team wallet
  - _Contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x18acF9DEB7F9535F4848a286b68C729AAc55697a_
  - _`TreasureClaimed` transaction: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x5befdc8a6eb15f03a56a973003c799848aa38178e5c4613dd36b8aae5f4ce2ae_
