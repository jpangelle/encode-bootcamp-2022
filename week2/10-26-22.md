# Homework 7

## Adding more functionality to the Volcano Coin contract

1. We made a payment mapping, but we havenʼt added all the functionality for it yet. Write a function to view the payment records, specifying the user as an input. What is the difference between doing this and making the mapping public?

> When making the variable public, it is required to search by the address AND the amount. Instead, we want to make a function that will return the entire array of payments for a given address.

2. For the payments record mapping, create a function called that takes:

   1. the senderʼs address ✅
   2. the receiverʼs address and ✅
   3. the amount as an input, then creates a new payment record and adds the new record to the userʼs payment record ✅

3. Each time we make a transfer of tokens, we should call the this function to record the transfer ✅
