# Homework 17

1. Create a fork of mainnet (details below) ✅
2. On the command line check the current block height, is this what you expected?

   > 15973154 and was expecting this

3. Can you transfer ETH from one of Vitalik's accounts to your own account? ✅

```js
const vitalik = await ethers.getImpersonatedSigner(
  "0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B"
);
await vitalik.sendTransaction({
  to: "0x89E27f651186DE46D656f8Cd55bA9620dc556320",
  value: 1000000000000000,

await ethers.provider.getBalance("0x89E27f651186DE46D656f8Cd55bA9620dc556320");
```

## Creating a fork of mainnet

- See also lesson 9
- See hardhat [documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/guides/forking-other-networks)
- You first need to have an account on [Infura](https://www.infura.io/[) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). This will give you a key so that you can use their RPC nodes.

## Forking using ganache

```sh
$ npx ganache-cli --f https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<your key> -m "your 12 word mnemonic" --unlock <address> -i <chain ID>
```

## Fork from hardhat

```sh
$ npx hardhat node --fork https://ethmainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<your key>
```

In hardhat you can also specify this in the config file

```
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    forking: {
      url: "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<key>",
    }
  }
}
```
