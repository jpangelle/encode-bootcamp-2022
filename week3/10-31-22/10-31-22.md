## Volcano NFT

We now want to create an NFT. We will use the Open Zeppelin libraries to help with this.

1.  Create a new project in the IDE of you choice called NFTProject ✅
2.  Create a VolcanoNFT contract this should inherit from any [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) implementation from the Open Zeppelin standard [libraries](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721) ✅
3.  Give your NFT a name and a symbol ✅
4.  Write unit tests to check that you can
    1. Mint new NFTs ✅
    2. Transfer an NFT ✅
5.  Deploy your contract to Goerli and send some NFTs to your colleagues ✅
