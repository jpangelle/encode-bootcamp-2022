# Homework 11

## Continue developing your Volcano NFT project

1. Add a function that allows a user to mint an NFT if they pay 0.01 ETH, or an amount of Volcano coin (decide on a price yourself). ✅
2. Make sure that when a token is minted we can specify a token URI - a location where we can store metadata / images for the NFT. ✅
3. What would be the problem with providing a function to allow us to change the token URI?
   > The token URI is stored on the blockchain, so if we change it, the old URI will still be stored on the blockchain which can create confusion on which one is the correct one or legitimate URI.
4. Review the notes about the EVM in Lesson 5 in preparation for tomorrow's lesson about gas optimisation. ✅
